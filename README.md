One of my first ever fully functioning computer programs that's not as simple as a "Hello World". Putting this in the hall of fame for its sentimental value. 

I find it interesting now, looking back, that part of the assessment was to do a full manual desk check of the whole program. This, combined with the fact that we had to use an ancient compiler like Dev C++ with limited IDE assistance, meant that we were trained to be more independent programmers that don't need to be hand-holded in our coding. We were also expected to write out our codes on papers for exams which means we are more coding-minded generally speaking. Not sure where you might sit on the debate of learning with tool assistance like code predictions in the modern day and age, but I know for my own development, all of this meant that I am much more resilient and much less coddled when I code. Directly translates to being able to get more work done in a shorter time-frame because our minds are trained to retain recurringly used information while we code rather than having to look up every few seconds on the right syntax to get something done. Also helps with language agnosticism.

Though, I will admit - there was an adjustment period transitioning to better IDEs when we were free to do so but after that adjustment period, I generally do feel I came out better.
